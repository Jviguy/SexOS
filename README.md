# SexOS
A small and simple OS / kernel that supports barely anything. <br>
## Compiling
This OS is only i686 (triple) which is x86 as of now and should only be ran in virtual enviroments.<br>
### Using the scripts
as of now a iso can be compiled very easily with the iso.sh script, but will still require you to have the needed libs, i686-gcc and i686-binutis (as, ld, etc...).
